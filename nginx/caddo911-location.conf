# Example Nginx config to serve this app at:
#   https://vincentlarkin.com/caddo911/
#
# IMPORTANT: The trailing slash on `location /caddo911/` and the trailing slash
# on `proxy_pass .../` ensure Nginx STRIPS the /caddo911/ prefix before proxying.
# That means your backend can keep routes like /api/status, /images/*, etc.
#
# If you host on a NAS reverse proxy UI (Synology/QNAP), the concept is the same:
# map the path prefix /caddo911/ to the backend's root /.

# Redirect /caddo911 → /caddo911/
location = /caddo911 {
  return 301 /caddo911/;
}

location /caddo911/ {
  # If your app runs on the same box:
  proxy_pass http://127.0.0.1:3911/;

  # If your app runs in Docker on a bridge network, it may be:
  # proxy_pass http://caddo911-web:3911/;
